# Save Variables

Trad Rack uses
[save_variables](https://docs.kalico.gg/Config_Reference.html#save_variables)
to save variables to disk so that they can be used across restarts.
This document lists all of the variables that Trad Rack saves to disk.

## Bowden lengths

The following variables are used for storing bowden length data,
which is used to set "bowden_load_length" and "bowden_unload_length"
after a restart. See the
[Tuning document](/docs/Tuning.md) for details on how
"bowden_load_length" and "bowden_unload_length" are used:

- `tr_calib_bowden_load_length`: Dict containing the following bowden
  load length data. This variable is saved each time the toolhead is
  loaded[^1]:
  - `new_set_length`: The last calibrated "bowden_load_length".
  - `sample_count`: The number of samples that were averaged to
    determine `new_set_length`.
- `tr_calib_bowden_unload_length`: Dict containing the following
  bowden unload length data. This variable is saved each time the
  toolhead is unloaded:
  - `new_set_length`: The last calibrated "bowden_unload_length".
  - `sample_count`: The number of samples that were averaged to
    determine `new_set_length`.
- `tr_config_bowden_length`: The value of `bowden_length` at the time
  that bowden length data was last saved. On a restart, the saved
  bowden length data will be ignored if `bowden_length` does not match
  `tr_config_bowden_length`. This variable is saved each time Kalico
  starts.

[^1]: If `toolhead_fil_sensor_pin` is not specified or
`load_with_toolhead_sensor` is False, `tr_calib_bowden_load_length`
will not be saved.

## Other variables

The following miscellaneous variables are saved:

- `tr_last_heater_target`: Extruder target temperature that was set by
  the user the last time the toolhead was loaded. This variable may be
  used by the
  [TR_LOAD_TOOLHEAD or TR_UNLOAD_TOOLHEAD gcode commands](G-Codes.md)
  for setting the extruder temperature before unloading/loading. This
  variable is saved each time the toolhead is loaded.
- `tr_active_lane`: Last "active lane" (lane from which filament is
  currently loaded in the toolhead). If `save_active_lane` is set to
  True in the 
  [trad_rack config section](Config_Reference.md#trad_rack),
  then this variable is saved whenever the active lane is set (when
  the toolhead is loaded or unloaded, when the active lane is manually
  set or reset, etc.). If `save_active_lane` is True and this variable
  is not None, the variable will be used by the
  [TR_LOCATE_SELECTOR gcode command](G-Codes.md#tr_locate_selector) to
  infer the active lane if the selector filament sensor is triggered
  but no active lane was set since the last restart.
