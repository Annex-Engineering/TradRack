# RIDGA parts

The parts in this folder allow using the BMG Reverse Integrated Drive
Gear Assembly (RIDGA) in place of the 50T spur/shaft and drive
gear, with 4x8x3.0mm bearings in place of the 5x8x2.5mm ones normally
used with the BMG.

These parts are meant for use with RIDGA V1. If you are using RIDAGA
V2, you can use the normal parts instead of the ones from this folder.

## Replaced parts

The parts in this folder replace the following parts:

- STLs:
  - Selector:
    - `carriage_left_x1`
  - Tilting Filament Driver:
    - `motor_plate_x1`

## eDrawing/Instructions

Until this option gets its own configuration in the eDrawing, you can
use the default configuration for reference but with the following
changes:

- omit the 0.5mm shim next to the drive gear
- optional: omit the `nema_17_spacer_x1` printed part
