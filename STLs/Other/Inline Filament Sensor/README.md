This sensor was made to be a fallback option for a toolhead sensor
if your particular toolhead does not have an existing option to
integrate a sensor.

The sensor is meant to be placed right above the toolhead, with the
reverse bowden tube entering the sensor and 2nd short piece of bowden
tube connecting the sensor to the toolhead's bowden collet. 

The following hardware is required. See the Trad Rack BOM for sources:

- 1X 4mm Ball Bearing
- 1X Omron D2F Microswitch
- 2X M2 Pan Head Self Tapping Screw (10mm length minimum)
- 1X Nylon Cable Tie

In addition to the above, you will need 2 bowden collets and collet
clips. You can use either collets with an outer diameter of about 5mm
on the section the clip goes around (such as those used by E3D on
the V6 hotend and by Bondtech on the LGX and LGX Lite), or collets
with an outer diameter of about 6mm (such as those available from
TriangleLab).

Make sure to secure the wires to the sensor housing with a zip tie to
avoid movement at the solder joints:

Either end of the sensor can be used as the entry/exit; you can choose
the orientation of the sensor based on which way you want the wires to
go.
